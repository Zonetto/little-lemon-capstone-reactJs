# Little Lemon Capstone (ReactJS)

This project was created during Meta's Coursera **Front-End Development** course. It is the culmination of the **Front-End Development Track** and showcases the implementation of a booking application for the Little Lemon Website.

The website was built using **React Components** to demonstrate how React can be utilized for creating functional and dynamic web applications. It also includes the integration of **API calls**. Currently, the only working functionality is the **Reserve a Table** feature, in addition to the responsive design.

- **Dynamic Booking Functionality**: Reserve a table through an interactive form.
- **React Components**: Modular and reusable components for cleaner, maintainable code.
- **API Integration**: Utilizes API calls to handle booking data dynamically.
